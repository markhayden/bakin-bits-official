# Pixel — agent package

Reference agent package for Bakin's image artist — crafts prompts, iterates on outputs, and owns visual quality.

## Notable choices

- **No bundled skill.** Pixel works entirely through Bakin's image tools (`bakin_exec_images_*`), which route to the configured provider and save managed versioned assets — no custom skill to project into her workspace.
- **AGENTS.md ships only Pixel-specific content.** The `bakin:mission-control`, `bakin:hard-rules`, `bakin:dependency-pattern`, `bakin:media-delegation`, `bakin:workflow-rules`, `bakin:asset-rules`, and `bakin:scheduling-rules` blocks are *not* in the package source — `bakin doctor` injects them on install and keeps them current as Bakin's defaults evolve.
- **Three lesson files**: two default-enabled (`prompt-style-system.md` covers prompt anatomy and iteration; `visual-styles.md` is the photo-real / hyper-real / Pixar-3D / editorial taxonomy) and one opt-in (`social-media-craft.md` covers viral patterns, click-bait without being slimy, and platform-specific aesthetics — only injected when the agent is doing social work). More lessons can be added later without a manifest change — drop a frontmatter'd `.md` in `lessons/` and bump the version.
- **`agent.allowedTools` and `allowedSkills`** are declarative for now. When the dispatch-routing layer reads them, they will enforce hard scoping at the MCP boundary.

## Installing

```bash
bakin agents install ./agents/pixel
```

To attach the package to an already-existing `pixel` agent without overwriting their workspace files:
```bash
bakin agents install ./agents/pixel --adopt pixel
```
